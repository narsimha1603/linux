#Active processes are the ones currently running. You can use:
ps -ef

#Display Zombie Processes
#Zombie processes are defunct processes that remain in the process table. To list them:
ps -ef | grep defunct

#Remove (Kill) Unwanted Processes
#Once you identify the PID (Process ID) of the unwanted process, you can terminate it:
kill -9 <PID>

18.	Display the lines NOT matched with given pattern using grep command.

#Suppose sample.txt contains:
Linux is powerful
Unix is stable
Linux is open source
Unix is widely used

#display lines that do NOT contain "Linux":
grep -v "Linux" sample.txt

#Output
Unix is stable
Unix is widely used

19.	Write the following Shell script to find factorial of a given integer.
#factorial.sh
if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 number"
    exit 1
fi
num=$1
fact=1
for (( i=1; i<=num; i++ ))
do
    fact=$((fact * i))
done
echo "Factorial of $num is: $fact"

chmod +x factorial.sh

#Run it with an integer:
./factorial.sh 5

#output:
Factorial of 5 is: 120
