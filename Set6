3	C	90	71	96
4	D	82	70	85


#Create marks.txt Using cat with redirection
cat > marks.txt <<EOF
s.no name test1 test2 test3
1 A 75 81 89
2 B 86 94 82
3 C 90 71 96
4 D 82 70 85
EOF

#Use awk to calculate total
awk 'NR>1 { total=$3+$4+$5; print $2, total }' marks.txt

#output:
A 245
B 262
C 257
D 237

3.	Write a shell script that receives any number of file names as arguments checks if every argument supplied is a file or a directory and reports accordingly. Whenever the argument is a file, the number of lines on it is also reported..

#check_files.sh
if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 file_or_directory [file_or_directory ...]"
    exit 1
fi
for item in "$@"
do
    if [ -f "$item" ]; then
        # It's a file → count lines
        lines=$(wc -l < "$item")
        echo "'$item' is a file with $lines lines."
    elif [ -d "$item" ]; then
        # It's a directory
        echo "'$item' is a directory."
    else
        # Neither file nor directory
        echo "'$item' does not exist."
    fi
done

chmod +x check_files.sh

./check_files.sh sample.txt marks.txt /home /etc
